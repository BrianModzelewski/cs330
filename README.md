My design talents will be useful in the future by giving an organized and efficient way to handling difficult challenges. This involves the capacity to deconstruct huge systems into manageable components, predict possible problems, and build designs that are adaptive to changing requirements.


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I tried out numerous fresh development tactics while working on my 3D scene project. Component-based design was one significant method, allowing for more modular and reusable programming. In addition, to assure code dependability and maintainability, I employed test-driven development (TDD). Iteration was critical in the development process. I started with a simple prototype to evaluate the viability of the 3D rendering engine. Then I went through several iterations, adding functionality, increasing efficiency, and improving the user experience. This iterative process enabled ongoing development and alignment with project objectives. My approach to code development altered dramatically across the project milestones. I became more aware of the importance of code order and readability. I also began utilizing version control tools to monitor changes and easily work with team members. These modifications aided in the project's completion by streamlining the development process.
